## Overview

### Description

An app to keep track of any novelty items collected from each state in the USA.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Travel
- **Mobile:** (Maps, location, camera, real-time) If you're traveling to a different state to get a shot glass or other novelty collector's item, you don't need to bring your laptop. Camera can be for taking pictures of the novelty item to add to the marker on the map view.
- **Story:** Personally I have been trying to collect shot glasses from every state so an app to keep track of which states I've gotten shot glasses from and where I still need to go.
- **Market:** Anybody trying to start or already has a collection from states in the USA.
- **Habit:** Whenever a new novelty item is collected this app would be used to record it.
- **Scope:** V1 could be a checklist view sortable by completed/alphabetical states and then V2 could include a map view of the USA with markers on each of the completed states and incomplete states shaded in red.
