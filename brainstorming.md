## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. USA Novelty Collection Tracker 
    * **Description:** An app to keep track of any novelty items collected from each state in the USA.
    * **Category:** Travel
    * **Mobile:** (Maps, location, camera, real-time) If you're traveling to a different state to get a shot glass or other novelty collector's item, you don't need to bring your laptop. Camera can be for taking pictures of the novelty item to add to the marker on the map view.
    * **Story:** Personally I have been trying to collect shot glasses from every state so an app to keep track of which states I've gotten shot glasses from and where I still need to go.
    * **Market:** Anybody trying to start or already has a collection from states in the USA.
    * **Habit:** Whenever a new novelty item is collected this app would be used to record it.
    * **Scope:** V1 could be a checklist view sortable by completed/alphabetical states and then V2 could include a map view of the USA with markers on each of the completed states and incomplete states shaded in red.

2. Daily Tracker with Experience System
    * **Description:** An app that allows the user to load daily repetitive activities and then keep track of how often they stick to their routine. Users that do well at sticking to productive daily tasks get rewarded with experience for flashy badges or other decorative trophy items.
    * **Category:** Productivity
    * **Mobile:** (Push notifications, real-time) Keep the user on track if they're looking like they're about to miss a day with push notifications.
    * **Market:** People trying to better themselves. Could be used for exercise, intellectual reasons like LeetCode, etc.
    * **Habit:** Daily check-ins for more experience gains.
    * **Scope:** V1 could be a list icon view by day and then V2 could be a calendar view sorted by day or activity

3. Meme Game
    * **Description:** A game that actually works like the false ads show on Instagram or TikTok
    * **Category:** Entertainment
    * **Mobile:** (Audio, sensors, push notifications, real-time) Can take the game on the go like on public transportation and play with headphones on for best audio quality
    * **Story:** I have seen advertisements for games that look and play nothing like the actual game (usually has to do with shooting zombies or collecting levels to become a stronger soldier)
    * **Market:** Mobile gamers or bored Instagram or TikTok users doomscrolling.
    * **Habit:** If the gameplay is well made, it should already be addicting.
    * **Scope:** Very challenging to complete by end of program without having done any game creation during the course of this program.
